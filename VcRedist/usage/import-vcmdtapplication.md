# Import Redistributables into MDT

To install the Visual C++ Redistributables as a part of a reference image or for use with a deployment solution based on the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit, `Import-VcMdtApplication` will import each of the Visual C++ Redistributables as separate applications that includes the passive or silent command lines, platform support and the UninstallKey for detecting whether the Visual C++ Redistributable is already installed. Visual C++ Redistributables can be filtered for release and processor architecture by `Get-VcList` before passing to `Import-VcMdtApplication`.

## Parameters

### Required parameters

* `VcList` - An array containing details of the Visual C++ Redistributables from `Get-VcList`
* `Path` - A folder containing the downloaded Visual C++ Redistributables downloaded with `Save-VcList`
* `MdtPath` - the local or network path to the MDT deployment share

### Optional parameters

* `Silent` - Configures the MDT application quiet install command to be completely silent instead of using the default passive install command line
* `Force` - Forces overwrite of an existing Visual C++ Redistributable application
* `AppFolder` - Imports the Visual C++ Redistributables into a sub-folder. Defaults to "VcRedists"
* `MdtDrive` - The drive letter that will be mapped to the MDT deployment share. Not required and defaults to "DS001"
* `Publisher` - The publisher that will be assigned to the Visual C++ Redistributables bundle. Not required and defaults to "Microsoft"
* `BundleName` - The bundle short name assigned to the Visual C++ Redistributables bundle. Not required and defaults to "Visual C++ Redistributables"
* `Language` - The language assigned to the Visual C++ Redistributables bundle. Defaults to "en-US"

## Examples

Import the 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2019 supported Redistributables into an MDT deployment share:

```powershell
$VcList = Get-VcList
Import-VcMdtApplication -VcList $VcList -Path C:\Temp\VcRedist -MdtPath \\server\deployment
```

Each Redistributable will be imported into the deployment share with application properties required for a successful deployment.

The folder structure in the deployment share, will look thus:

The install command line arguments used by default are passive. Fully silent install command line arguments can be specified with the `-Silent` parameter when importing the applications into an MDT deployment share.

```powershell
$VcList = Get-VcList
Import-VcMdtApp -VcList $VcList -Path C:\Temp\VcRedist -MdtPath \\server\deployment -Silent
```
