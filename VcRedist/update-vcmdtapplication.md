# Update Redistributables in MDT

Use `Update-VcMdtApplication` to update the Visual C++ Redistributables that have previously been imported into the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit by `Import-VcMdtApplication`. As updates Visual C++ Redistributables are released (typically updates to existing versions), the existing applications may require updating. While `Import-VcMdtApplication` supports the `-Force` parameter, it will first delete the exsiting application and re-import it. `Update-VcMdtApplication` will update the properties of the existing application, keeping the application GUID intact.

## Parameters

### Required parameters

* `VcList` - An array containing details of the Visual C++ Redistributables from `Get-VcList`
* `Path` - A folder containing the downloaded Visual C++ Redistributables downloaded with `Save-VcList`
* `MdtPath` - the local or network path to the MDT deployment share

### Optional parameters

* `Silent` - Configures the MDT application quiet install command to be completely silent instead of using the default passive install command line
* `Force` - Forces overwrite of an existing Visual C++ Redistributable application
* `AppFolder` - Imports the Visual C++ Redistributables into a sub-folder. Defaults to "VcRedists"
* `MdtDrive` - The drive letter that will be mapped to the MDT deployment share. Not required and defaults to "DS001"
* `Publisher` - The publisher that will be assigned to the Visual C++ Redistributables bundle. Not required and defaults to "Microsoft"
* `Language` - The language assigned to the Visual C++ Redistributables bundle. Defaults to "en-US"

## Examples

Update the 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2019 supported Redistributables in an MDT deployment share with the fully silent install command line:

```powershell
$VcList = Get-VcList
Update-VcMdtApplication -VcList $VcList -Path C:\Temp\VcRedist -MdtPath \\server\deployment -Silent
```
